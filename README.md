![](./header.jpg)


Hello and welcome to **Pandas for Business** - Introductory Training Session, as part of Women In Data Event 2023.

Please follow the instructions below **ahead** of the session on 2023-03-09, if you would like to follow along during the training:
- The **wid2023** public repository contains all documentation and materials covered in the training:
	- **wid_pre_requisites.pdf** is a PDF file with detailed guidance on how to install Python, Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks. This will be essential if you want to execute the demonstrated code during training
	- **insurance.csv** is the CSV file containing the dataset, with which we will be working throughout the session. Please download this file and place it in a **pandas_for_business** folder somewhere on your C-drive
	- **pandas_for_business.ipynb** is the Jupyter Notebook, which we will cover during the training. Please download this file and place in **pandas_for_business** folder (i.e. the folder containing the **insurance.csv** file)


To download the full content of this public repository, click on the green **Clone** button on the home page - then select the **Download ZIP** option.

Lastly, if you would rather observe the training and not run any code/don't have the chance to complete all steps listed above, you can click on the **pandas_for_business.ipynb** file and get it displayed on your screen straight away. Although the file won't be interactive to you, you can still follow along - the training session will give you a live demonstration on how Pandas works!
